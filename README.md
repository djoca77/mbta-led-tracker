# mbta-led-tracker

This is an LED train tracker for the MBTA in Boston. At the moment, this handles the red, blue and orange lines, with green line functionality coming soon. The python script mbta_api is run with either a northbound or southbound command in the command line (n or s respectively). The Arduino must be plugged in at the same time as the script is run for everything to work correctly.
